# RAM-OP
Rapid Assessment Method for Older People

[HelpAge International](http://www.helpage.org), [VALID International](http://www.validinternational.org), and [Brixton Health](http://www.brixtonhealth.com), with financial assistance from the [Humanitarian Innovation Fund (HIF)](http://www.elrha.org/hif/home/), have developed a **Rapid Assessment Method for Older People (RAM-OP)** that provides accurate and reliable estimates of the needs of older people. The method uses simple procedures, in a short time frame (i.e. about two weeks including training, data collection, data entry, and data analysis), and at considerably lower cost than other methods. The **RAM-OP** method is based on the following principles:

* Use of a familiar *“household survey”* design employing a two-stage cluster sample design optimised to allow the use of a small primary sample ( m ≥ 16 clusters) and a small overall ( n ≥ 192) sample.

* Assessment of multiple dimensions of need in older people (including prevalence of global, moderate and severe acute malnutrition) using, whenever possible, standard and well-tested indicators and question sets.

* Data analysis performed using modern computer-intensive methods to allow estimates of indicator levels to be made with useful precision using a small sample size.
