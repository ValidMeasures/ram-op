[HelpAge International](http://www.helpage.org), [VALID International](http://www.validinternational.org), 
and [Brixton Health](http://www.brixtonhealth.com), with financial assistance from 
the [Humanitarian Innovation Fund (HIF)](http://www.elrha.org/hif/home/), have 
developed a **Rapid Assessment Method for Older People (RAM-OP)** that provides 
accurate and reliable estimates of the needs of older people. The method uses 
simple procedures, in a short time frame (i.e. about two weeks including training, 
data collection, data entry, and data analysis), and at considerably lower cost 
than other methods. The **RAM-OP** method is based on the following principles:

* Use of a familiar *“household survey”* design employing a two-stage cluster 
sample design optimised to allow the use of a small primary sample (*m* ≥ 16 clusters) 
and a small overall (*n* ≥ 192) sample.

* Assessment of multiple dimensions of need in older people (including prevalence 
of global, moderate and severe acute malnutrition) using, whenever possible, standard 
and well-tested indicators and question sets.

* Data analysis performed using modern computer-intensive methods to allow estimates 
of indicator levels to be made with useful precision using a small sample size.


## Getting started

The following tools are currently available under the General Public Licence / Free Documentation License 
(see [LICENSE](https://github.com/validmeasures/oldr/blob/master/LICENSE)), meaning 
that you are free to copy and adapt these tools:

* an English language manual / guidebook
* a questionnaire (available in English and French)
* data entry and data checking software (available in English and French)
* data analysis software

### Installing

This package is currently in active development in preparation for submission to
the CRAN repository. The development version of `oldr` can be installed in R
via the following commands:

```R
# Install devtools
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("validmeaures/oldr")
```

## Built with

* [EpiData](http://www.epidata.dk) for data entry of *pen and paper interviews (PAPI)*
* [Open Data Kit](https://opendatakit.org) for data collection using electronic mobile devices
* [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [RAnalyticFlow](http://r.analyticflow.com) for data analysis
