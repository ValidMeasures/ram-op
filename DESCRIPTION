Description: An implementation of the Rapid Assessment Method for Older People
    (RAM-OP). RAM-OP was developed by HelpAge International, Valid International, 
    and Brixton Health, with financial assistance from the Humanitarian 
    Innovation Fund (HIF). It provides various functions that allow the user to
    design and plan the assessment and analyse the collected data. RAM-OP
    provides accurate and reliable estimates of the needs of older people. 
    The method uses simple procedures, in a short time frame (i.e. about two 
    weeks including training, data collection, data entry, and data analysis), 
    and at considerably lower cost than other methods.
