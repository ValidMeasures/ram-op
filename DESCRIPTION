Description: An implementation of the Rapid Assessment Method for Older People
    or RAM-OP <https://www.helpage.org/what-we-do/emergencies/ramop-rapid-assessment-method-for-older-people/>. 
    It provides various functions that allow the user to design and plan the 
    assessment and analyse the collected data. RAM-OP provides accurate and 
    reliable estimates of the needs of older people. The method uses simple 
    procedures, in a short time frame (i.e. about two weeks including training, 
    data collection, data entry, and data analysis), and at considerably lower 
    cost than other methods.
