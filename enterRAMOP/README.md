The EpiData Association  - contributions and donations
EpiData is - from version 2.0 - released by the non-profit organisation “The EpiData Association” Odense, Denmark  (In danish: EpiData Foreningen). EpiData has been made on a very small budget and is supplied as free-ware to the international community. Only parts of the development has been paid for after version 1.5. Further financial support is needed (e.g. refining of programming, enhancing speed, translation principles, basic analysis of data, maintenance of website, to pay for absence from paid work to do EpiData or other developmental and promotional efforts for EpiData). 

If you like EpiData then please consider giving a donation for further development. See the help file for details.
